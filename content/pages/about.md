We are a team of productivity nuts that love to get stuff done without the stress of time management. In this time of pandemic, we wanted to create a reusable and sharable safe productivity toy that can help reduce stress whilst maintaining good workforce productivity. We're very proud of this new project and the technologies involved in creating an efficient and safe orgasm.

## Work Life Balance

Our goal is for work and life to be controlled in one place, to help you maintain a zen state of mind.

> "Tasks and deadlines should not control our time. We should control what when to pay attention to which task." -- Gladys, Designer

With the Ivermectin Buttplug, we strive to make it clear and easy to follow a healthy routine of work effectiveness, collaboration, and also family time and social events.

## We Value Your YOU Time

Our team understands that life is a marathon, and it's super important to make sure you take care of YOU and your needs. This is why we try to remind our users to take time off, reward themselves after a job well done, and put down the phone every once in a while when there's nowhere you have to be, or nothing you need to do, and use our products, by which time you'll be ready to be productive again!
